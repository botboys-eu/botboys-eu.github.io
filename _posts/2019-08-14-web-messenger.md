The BotBoys Web Messenger will add live web messaging to your website or web app.

## Usage

### Script Tag

Add the following code towards the end of the `head` section on your page and replace `<app-id>` with your app id at the end of the script.

```html
<script>
    !function(e,n,t,r){function o(){try{var e;if((e="string"==typeof this.response?JSON.parse(this.response):this.response).url){var t=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],r=n.createElement("script");r.async=!0,r.src=e.url,t.parentNode.insertBefore(r,t)}}catch(e){}}var s,p,a,c=[],i=[];e[t]={init:function(){s=arguments;var e={then:function(n){return i.push({type:"t",next:n}),e},catch:function(n){return i.push({type:"c",next:n}),e}};return e},on:function(){c.push(arguments)},render:function(){p=arguments},destroy:function(){a=arguments}},e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__=function(n){if(delete e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__,e[t]=n,s)for(var r=n.init.apply(n,s),o=0;o<i.length;o++){var u=i[o];r="t"===u.type?r.then(u.next):r.catch(u.next)}p&&n.render.apply(n,p),a&&n.destroy.apply(n,a);for(o=0;o<c.length;o++)n.on.apply(n,c[o])};var u=new XMLHttpRequest;u.addEventListener("load",o),u.open("GET","https://cdn.botboys.com/loader.json",!0),u.responseType="json",u.send()}(window,document,"BotBoys");
</script>
```

then initialize the Web Messenger by placing this snippet towards the end of the `body` section of your page.

```html
<script>
    BotBoys.init({appId: '<app-id>'}).then(function() {
        // Your code after init is complete
    });
</script>
```

## API

### Individual functions

#### init(options)
Initializes the BotBoys widget in the web page using the specified options. It returns a promise that will resolve when the Web Messenger is ready. Note that except`on` and `off`, all methods needs to be called after a successful `init`.

##### Options

| Option | Optional? | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| appId | No | - | Your app id |
| region | Yes | - | The target region in which the app is located. |
| userId | Yes | - | Optional. User's id, which can be passed in `init()` as an alternative to `login()` (see [below](#authenticating-the-user-init-vs-login)) |
| jwt | Yes | - | Optional. User's authentication token, which can be passed in `init()` as an alternative to `login()` (see [below](#authenticating-the-user-init-vs-login)) |
| authCode | Yes | - | An auth code for linking to an existing conversation |
| locale | Yes | `en-US` | Locale used for date formatting using the `<language>-<COUNTRY>` format. Language codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). <br /> **Note 1 : ** The country part is optional, and if a country is either not recognized or supported, it will fallback to using the generic language. If the language isn't supported, it will fallback to `en-US`. <br /> **Note 2:** this is *only* used for date formatting and doesn't provide built-in translations for Web Messenger. |
| soundNotificationEnabled | Yes | `true` | Enables the sound notification for new messages |
| imageUploadEnabled | Yes | `true` | Enables the image upload feature. (deprecated: use menuItems.imageUpload; if this option is `false`, it will disable `menuItems.imageUpload` and `menuItems.fileUpload`) |
| fixedIntroPane | Yes | `false` | When enabled, the introduction pane will be pinned at the top of the conversation instead of scrolling with it. |
| embedded | Yes | False | Tells the widget it will be embedded. (see Embedded section below) |
| displayStyle | Yes | `button` | Choose how the messenger will appear on your website. Must be either `button` or `tab`.

| buttonHeight | Yes | `58px` | When the `displayStyle` is `button`, you have the option of specifying the button height.
| businessName | Yes | - | A custom business name.
| businessIconUrl | Yes | - | A custom business icon url. The image must be at least 200 x 200 pixels and must be in either JPG, PNG, or GIF format.
| backgroundImageUrl | Yes | - | A background image url for the conversation. Image will be tiled to fit the window.
| integrationOrder | Yes | - | Array of integration IDs. When set, only integrations from this list will be displayed. If an empty array is used, no integrations will be displayed. *Note*: Listing an integration in the array doesn't guarantee that it will be displayed in the Web Messenger.
| customColors | Yes | [See below.](#customcolors) | Colors used in the Web Messenger UI. |
| customText | Yes | See the example below | Strings used in the Web Messenger UI. You can use these to either customize the text or translate it. *Note*: Some strings include variables (surrounded by `{}`) which must remain in your customized text. |
| menuItems | Yes | [See below.](#menuitems) | Choose menu items. |
| notificationChannelPromptEnabled | Yes | `true` | Enables displaying a prompt to new users after their first message to suggest linking their chat instance with their other 3rd-party apps. |

#### open()
Opens the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
BotBoys.open();
```

#### close()
Closes the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
BotBoys.close();
```

#### isOpened()
Tells if the widget is currently opened or closed.

```javascript
BotBoys.isOpened();
```

#### login(userId , jwt)
Logs a user in the Web Messenger, retrieving the conversation the user already had on other browsers and/or devices. Note that you don't need to call this after `init` if you passed the user id and jwt already, it's done internally. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```javascript
BotBoys.login('some-id', 'some-jwt');
```

#### logout()
Logs out the current user and reinitialize the widget with an anonymous user. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```javascript
BotBoys.logout();
```

#### destroy()
Destroys the Web Messenger and makes it disappear. The Web Messenger has to be reinitialized with `init` to be working again because it also clears up the app id from the Web Messenger. It will also unbind all listeners you might have with `BotBoys.on`.

```javascript
BotBoys.destroy();
```

#### sendMessage(message)
Sends a message on the user's behalf

```javascript
BotBoys.sendMessage({
    type: 'text',
    text: 'hello'
});

// OR

BotBoys.sendMessage('hello');
```

#### startTyping()
Sends an event indicating the appUser has started typing. When called, a `stopTyping` timer will be created and will call `stopTyping()` after 10s, unless `stopTyping()` has been called manually. Everytime `startTyping()` is called the timer is reset. If `startTyping()` is called repeatedly, an event will only be sent if the time since the last sent event is greater then 10s.

```javascript
BotBoys.startTyping();
```

#### stopTyping()
Sends an event indicating the appUser has stoped typing.

```javascript
BotBoys.stopTyping();
```

#### triggerPostback(actionId)
Trigger a `postback` action on the user's behalf.
The `actionId` is the `_id` property of the targeted action.

If you have the `_id` of the targetted `postback` action, you can pass it directly to `triggerPostback`.

```javascript
const actionId = '5a747faa065bbe4e7804f2a4';
BotBoys.triggerPostback(actionId);
```

Otherwise, you can get the `_id` of an action by using `BotBoys.getConversation()`, e.g.

```javascript
const conversation = BotBoys.getConversation();

console.log(conversation.messages);
// [
//     {
//         "text": "Do you want to continue?",
//         "actions": [
//             {
//                 "payload": "text:continue",
//                 "text": "Continue conversation",
//                 "_id": "5a7c65211aaa9b61f69c95e3",
//                 "type": "postback"
//             }
//         ],
//         "type": "text",
//         "role": "appMaker",
//         "_id": "5a7c65211aaa9b61f69c95e2",
//         // ...
//     }
// ]

// Indicate that the user has clicked on the "Continue conversation" postback action.
BotBoys.triggerPostback(conversation.messages[0].actions[0]._id);
```

#### updateUser(user)
Updates user information

```javascript
BotBoys.updateUser({
    givenName: 'Updated',
    surname: 'Name',
    email: 'updated@email.com',
    properties: {
      'justGotUpdated': true
    }
});
```

#### getUser()
Returns the current user.

```javascript
var user = BotBoys.getUser()
```

#### getConversation()
Returns the conversation if it exists

```javascript
var conversation = BotBoys.getConversation();
```

#### startConversation()
Creates a user and conversation on the server, allowing the business to reach out proactively to the user via the public API.

It is strongly recommended to only call this method in the case where a message is likely to be sent.

This method is called automatically when starting a conversation via the `sendMessage` method, or when a user sends a message via the conversation view.

If a conversation already exists for the current user, this call is a no-op.

```javascript
BotBoys.startConversation();
```

#### markAllAsRead()
Marks all unread messages as read.

```javascript
BotBoys.markAllAsRead();
```

#### showNotificationChannelPrompt()
Displays a prompt to the user suggesting the linking of the current chat instance with other 3rd-party apps.

```javascript
BotBoys.showNotificationChannelPrompt();
```

#### setPredefinedMessage(message)
Prefills the user's chat input with a predefined message.

```javascript
BotBoys.setPredefinedMessage(message);
```

#### setDelegate(delegate)
Sets a delegate on the conversation. BotBoys must be initialized before calling this method. See the [delegate](#delegate) section for more details.

```javascript
BotBoys.setDelegate(delegate);
```

### Delegate
BotBoys allows you to set a delegate to receive callbacks when important changes happen in the conversation.
To set a delegate, pass the `delegate` parameter in to [init options](#options), or use the [setDelegate](#setdelegatedelegate) method. The `delegate` object may optionally contain `beforeDisplay`, `beforeSend`, `beforePostbackSend` and `onInvalidAuth` delegate functions.

```javascript
const delegate = {
    beforeDisplay(message) {
        return message;
    },
    beforeSend(message) {
        return message;
    },
    beforePostbackSend(postback) {
        return postback;
    },
    onInvalidAuth() {
        return new Promise((resolve) =>
            resolve('<my-new-auth-token>')
        )
    }
}

// Passing delegate as an init parameter
BotBoys.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',
    delegate
});

// Using setDelegate
BotBoys.init({ appId: '<app-id>' }).then(() => {
    BotBoys.setDelegate(delegate);
});
```

#### beforeDisplay
The `beforeDisplay` delegate allows a message to be hidden or modified before it is displayed in the conversation. This delegate should return a falsy value such as `null` to hide the message. It can also return a modified message object in order to change what the user will see rendered in their conversation history. Note that this change affects the client side rendering only; the server side copy of this message can not be modified by this delegate.

```javascript
BotBoys.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',
    delegate: {
        beforeDisplay(message) {
            if (message.metadata && message.metadata.isHidden) {
                return null;
            }

            return message;
        }
    }
});
```

#### beforeSend
The `beforeSend` delegate method allows you to modify properties of a message before sending it to BotBoys.
The modified message must be returned for it to take effect.

Note that when a file or an image is uploaded, only the message `metadata` may be updated. Other message properties such as `type` or `text` won't be considered.

```javascript
BotBoys.init({
    appId: '<app-id>'
    delegate: {
        beforeSend(message) {
            message.metadata = {
                any: 'info'
            };

            return message;
        }
    }
});
```

#### beforePostbackSend
The `beforePostbackSend` delegate method allows you to modify properties of a postback before sending it to BotBoys.
The modified postback must be returned for it to take effect.

 ```javascript
BotBoys.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',
    delegate: {
        beforePostbackSend(postback) {
            postback.metadata = {
                any: 'info'
            };

            return postback;
        }
    }
});
```

#### onInvalidAuth
The `onInvalidAuth` delegate notifies the delegate of a failed request due to invalid credentials and allows the implementer to set a new auth token in order to retry the request. The delegate must return a new JWT token as a `string` or `Promise<string>` that will resolve into the JWT.

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',
    delegate: {
        onInvalidAuth() {
            return '<my-new-auth-token>';
        }
    }
});
```

### Events
If you want to make sure your events are triggered, try to bind them before calling `BotBoys.init`.

To bind an event, use `BotBoys.on(<event name>, <handler>);`. To unbind events, you can either call `BotBoys.off(<event name>, handler)` to remove one specific handler, call `BotBoys.off(<event name>)` to remove all handlers for an event, or call `BotBoys.off()` to unbind all handlers.

#### ready
```javascript
// This event triggers when init completes successfully... Be sure to bind before calling init!
BotBoys.on('ready', function(){
    console.log('the init has completed!');
});

BotBoys.init(...).then(function() {
    // Your code after init is complete
});
```

#### destroy
```javascript
// This event triggers when the widget is destroyed.
BotBoys.on('destroy', function(){
    console.log('the widget is destroyed!');
});

BotBoys.destroy();
```

#### message:received
```javascript
// This event triggers when the user receives a message
BotBoys.on('message:received', function(message) {
    console.log('the user received a message', message);
});
```

#### message:sent
```javascript
// This event triggers when the user sends a message
BotBoys.on('message:sent', function(message) {
    console.log('the user sent a message', message);
});
```

#### message
```javascript
// This event triggers when a message was added to the conversation
BotBoys.on('message', function(message) {
    console.log('a message was added to the conversation', message);
});
```

#### unreadCount
```javascript
// This event triggers when the number of unread messages changes
BotBoys.on('unreadCount', function(unreadCount) {
    console.log('the number of unread messages was updated', unreadCount);
});
```

#### widget:opened
```javascript
// This event triggers when the widget is opened
BotBoys.on('widget:opened', function() {
    console.log('Widget is opened!');
});
```

#### widget:closed
```javascript
// This event triggers when the widget is closed
BotBoys.on('widget:closed', function() {
    console.log('Widget is closed!');
});
```

#### connected
```javascript
// This event triggers when an active connection has been established for the first time,
// or when the connection has been re-established after a `disconnect` event.
BotBoys.on('connected', function(e) {
    console.log('Connected');
});
```

#### disconnected
```javascript
// This event triggers when an active connection is lost
// While disconnected, the client will not be able to recieve messages
BotBoys.on('disconnected', function(e) {
    console.log('Disonnected');
});
```

#### typing:start
```javascript
// This event triggers when appMaker starts typing
BotBoys.on('typing:start', function() {
    console.log('appMaker starts typing!');
});
```

#### typing:stop
```javascript
// This event triggers when appMaker stops typing
BotBoys.on('typing:stop', function() {
    console.log('appMaker stops typing!');
});
```

### Embedded mode
As describe above, to activate the embedded mode, you need to pass `embedded: true` when calling `BotBoys.init`. By doing so, you are disabling the auto-rendering mechanism and you will need to call `BotBoys.render` manually. This method accepts a DOM element which will be used as the container where the widget will be rendered.

```javascript
BotBoys.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',
    embedded: true
});

BotBoys.render(document.getElementById('chat-container'));
```

The embedded widget will take full width and height of the container. You must give it a height, otherwise, the widget will collapse.

### Authenticating the user: init() vs login()

For authenticated user scenarios, a user's credentials can be passed in to either `init()` or `login()`. The question remains: when should you use which?

When `init()` is called without a `userId` and `jwt`, the UI will be initialized in an anonymous user context, and the user will be able to send messages as an anonymous user. After `init()` has completed, `login()` may be called to authenticate the user and resume any existing conversation. This is useful if you want your users to be able to send messages before they've logged in to your website. Once a user does login and the browser is issued a valid `jwt`, `login()` may be called so that the user may continue the conversation in an authenticated session.

If however your use case requires that all users be logged in before they may send messages, then you should consider passing `userId` and `jwt` directly to the `init()` call upfront.

## Content Security Policy
If your deployment requires [CSP compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), add the following meta tag to your configuration.
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
    connect-src
        wss://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}}
        https://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}};
    font-src
        https://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}};
    script-src
        https://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}};
    style-src
        https://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}};
    img-src
        blob:
        https://*.{{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}};">
```
Note that an equivalent configuration can be done [server side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).

According to the channels you use, other domains may need to be added (these are used to display QR codes to link the Web Messenger conversation):
- LINE: https://qr-official.line.me
- WeChat: https://mp.weixin.qq.com

Note that your CSP configuration should also include any domains used to host images or files sent in messages.
If you require `blob:` to be excluded for `img-src`, you must disable the image upload feature via the [init settings](#initoptions).
